# Customer Personality Analysis

For Customer Personality, there are 2 main parts
1) Customer Segmentation
2) Association Rule Mining

**Segmentation** <br>
Customer Segmentation are usually first defined by business rules. Else, we can use clustering techniques to segment customers

**Association Rule Mining** <br>
Association rule mining is a data mining technique used to discover interesting relationships or patterns in large datasets. It focuses on finding associations or dependencies between items based on their co-occurrence in transactions or events.

The most commonly used algorithm for association rule mining is the Apriori algorithm.

In the project, I will be using "Customer Personality Analysis' dataset from Kaggle, this dataset is a detailed analysis of a companyâ€™s ideal customers. It helps a business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors and concerns of different types of customers.

I will be using 'Apriori Algorithm' to find the underlying relationships between the different characteristics of the customer.
